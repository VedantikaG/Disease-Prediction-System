### Discription
<p align="justify">
In this era of digitalization, people who live miles away from the
metropolitan cities spreading any type of awareness, education is a
complex task. People who live in rural areas who do not meet the
literacy level, people living in urban areas, who lack understanding
of many minor things related to technology but still own
smartphones for minimal use. Rural people do not get proper
medical facilities and in turn it affects the further treatment process.
Telemedicine is a ray of light for such people as such people living
in rural areas can at least diagnose the disease and can take some
precautionary measures further. Diabetes, Hypertension and
Thyroid are among those critical diseases and a huge number of
people are suffering from these diseases. Age, Insulin level,
Obesity, hereditary, bad diet, etc. To get temporarily diagnosed at
the patientâ€™s ease is what this system does. Disease prediction
system is a system which asks few questions related to particular
disease and predicts if the person is having that particular disease
or not. This system uses Support Vector Machine for prediction
purpose of these diseases viz. Hypertension, Diabetes and Thyroid.
The accuracy scores over train dataset are 86%, 78%, 96% and over
test data are 85%, 77%, 96% respectively.
